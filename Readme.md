Google Cloud's converter converter converts audio file to text. The result is a json encoded data.

This script will extract only the 'transcript' elemets from the json data file and print it out.

1. Save the data received as a plain text file (eg: transcribed.json)
2. Replace the filename in the php script
3. Run the script and see just the transcript elements printed out
4. You can run `php extract.php > extracted.txt` to save all the output to the given text file
